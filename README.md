# UiPathDU_InvoMan
Invoman in UiPath using Document Understanding

I have used Document Understanding concepts to achieve InvoMan in UiPath. Earlier we had to open the File to extract, but now we are extracting multiple files at the same time without opening the file. This will save more time and no need to open the files per execution.
